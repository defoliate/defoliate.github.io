## tip list

**build in data types**

int, float, double, short, long, char, bool

*Note:  <span style="color: red;">std::string</span> wasn't since it's defined by [standard libray](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5388685/c-is-string-a-built-in-data-type/5388729)*.

**return nothing**

must return a int in C++, or could be [without return](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30354097/how-to-printf-a-memory-address-in-c/30354164): 
```C++
int main(void) 
{//return 0;
}
```
