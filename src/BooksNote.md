## Programming Interview Exposed (4th)

**KNOW YOURSELF**

- Do you want long-term or short-term projects? Some programmers crave change, spending a few months at most on each project. If you like short-term projects and don’t mind trav- eling, a gig with a consulting company might make more sense than a more conventional corporate job.
- Does management interest you? Some coders have a long-term goal to become a manager, but others shiver at the very thought. If management is your goal, you need to develop lead- ership skills and demonstrate that you can manage the human parts of the software devel- opment equation as well as the technical pieces. If management is not your goal, look for companies with good technical career paths, so you’re not forced to manage people to be promoted. (You still need leadership skills to get promoted no matter which career path you choose, but leadership skills are separate from people-management skills.)
- Do you want to work for a big company? Working at big companies has advantages and disadvantages. For example, a large company may offer more job stability (although layoffs during downturns are common) and some kind of career path. It may also have a name brand that nontechies recognize. On the other hand, you may feel stifled by the bureaucracy, rigidness, and intracompany rivalry often found in bigger companies.
- Don’t bother with certifications. The authors of this book believe that programming cer- tificates are of limited value because very few such jobs require certification. Additionally, almost none of the programmers at the top employers have formal programming certificates, and these are the people interviewing/evaluating you. Instead of spending time getting one of the certifications, we suggest working on some of the other recommendations here (side projects, school).
- Recruiters and hiring committees like to see that you have multiple accomplishments—a pattern of getting things done.
